FOR SOME HBO SHOES, YOU GET TO SHOOT IN A FIVE STAR ITALIAN RESORT SURROUNDED BY BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, BUT I SAID, NO, THAT\\'S TOO EASY. I WANT TO SHOOT IN A FREEZING CANADIAN FOREST WHILE BEING CHASED AROUND BY A GUY WHOSE HEAD LOOKS LIKE A GENITAL WART. IT IS AN HONOR BEING A PART OF THESE HUGE FRANCHISEs LIKE \"GAME OF THRONES\" AND \"STAR WARS,\" BUT I\\'M STILL GETTING USED TO PEOPLE RECOGNIZING ME. THE OTHER DAY, A GUY STOPPED ME ON THE STREET AND SAYS, MY SON LOVES \"THE MANDALORIAN\" AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW, I\\'M FACE TIMING WITH A 6-YEAR-OLD WHO HAS NO IDEA WHO I AM BECAUSE MY CHARACTER WEARS A MASK THE ENTIRE SHOW. THE GUY IS LIKE, DO THE MANDO VOICE, BUT IT\\'S LIKE A BEDROOM VOICE. WITHOUT THE MASK, IT JUST SOUNDS PORNY. PEOPLE WALKING BY ON THE STREET SEE ME WHISPERING TO A 6-YEAR-OLD KID. I CAN BRING YOU IN WARM, OR I CAN BRING YOU IN COLD. EVEN THOUGH I CAME TO THE U.S. WHEN I WAS LITTLE, I WAS BORN IN CHILE, AND I HAVE 34 FIRST COUSINS WHO ARE STILL THERE. THEY\\'RE VERY PROUD OF ME. I KNOW THEY\\'RE PROUD BECAUSE THEY GIVE MY PHONE NUMBER TO EVERY PERSON THEY MEET, WHICH MEANS EVERY DAY, SOMEONE IN SANTIAGO WILL TEXT ME STUFF LIKE, CAN YOU COME TO MY WEDDING, OR CAN YOU SING MY PRIEST HAPPY BIRTHDAY, OR IS BABY YODA MEAN IN REAL LIFE. SO I HAVE TO BE LIKE NO, NO, AND HIS NAME IS GROGU. BUT MY COUSINS WEREN\\'T ALWAYS SO PROUD. EARLY IN MY CAREER, I PLAYED SMALL PARTS IN EVERY CRIME SHOW. I EVEN PLAYED TWO DIFFERENT CHARACTERS ON \"LAW AND ORDER.\" TITO CABASSA WHO LOOKED LIKE THIS. AND ONE YEAR LATER, I PLAYED REGGIE LUCKMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE THIS. AND THAT, MY FRIENDS, IS CALLED RANGE. BUT IT IS AMAZING TO BE HERE, LIKE I SAID. I WAS BORN IN CHILE, AND NINE MONTHS LATER, MY PARENTS FLED AND BROUGHT ME AND MY SISTER TO THE U.S. THEY WERE SO BRAVE, AND WITHOUT THEM, I WOULDN\\'T BE HERE IN THIS WONDERFUL COUNTRY, AND I CERTAINLY WOULDN\\'T BE STANDING HERE WITH YOU ALL TONIGHT. SO TO ALL MY FAMILY WATCHING IN CHILE, I WANT TO SAY [ SPEAKING NON-ENGLISH ] WHICH MEANS, I LOVE YOU, I MISS YOU, AND STOP GIVING OUT MY PHONE NUMBER. WE\\'VE GOT AN AMAZING SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.

      "\"[Music] it is my pleasure to welcome Dr Andrew right Andrew is the managing General partner of AI fund founder of deep learning AI and learn and Landing AI chairman and co-founder of Coursera in an Adjunct professor of computer science here at Stanford previously he had started and led the Google brain team which had helped Google adopt modern Ai and he was also director of the Stanford AI lab about 8 million people one in one thousand persons on the planet have taken an AI class from him and through both his education and his AI work he has changed numerous lives please welcome Dr Andrew [Music] foreign Thank you Lisa it's good to see everyone so what I want to do today is um chat you about some opportunities in AI so I've been seeing AI is a new electricity one of the difficult things to understand about AI is that it is a general purpose technology meaning that it's not useful only for one thing but it's useful for lots of different applications kind of like electricity if I was to ask you what is electricity good for you know it's not any one thing it's a lot of things so what I'd like to do is start off sharing with you how I view the technology landscape and this will lead into the set of opportunities so a lot of hype lots of excitement about Ai and I think a good way to think about AI is as a collection of tools so this includes a technique called supervised learning which is very good at recognizing things or labeling things and gents of AI which is relatively new exciting development if you're familiar with AI you may have heard of other tools but I'm going to talk less about these additional tools and I'll focus on a on what I think are currently the two most important tools which are supervised learning and generative AI so supervised learning is very good at labeling things or very good at Computing input to outputs or a to B mappings given input a give me an output B for example given an email we can use supervised learning to label it as spam or not\"\n",

      "\"I've ever had and that's positive sense of it and so I think the last decade was maybe the decade of large-scale supervised learning what we found starting about 10 15 years ago was if you were to train a small AI model to train a small neural network with small deep learning algorithm Basia small AI model maybe not on a very powerful computer then as you fed more data is performance would get better for a little bit but then it would flatten out it would plateau and it would stop being able to use the data to get better and better but if you were to train a very large AI model lots of compute on maybe powerful gpus then as we scaled up the amount of data we gave the machine learning model this performance would kind of keep on getting better and better so this is why when I started let the Google brain team the primary mission that I directed the team to solve at the time was let's just build really really large neural networks that we then fed a lot of data to and that recipe fortunately worked and I think the idea of driving large compute and large scale of data that recipes really helped us driven a lot of AI progress over the last decade so if that was the last decade of AI I think this decade is turning out to be also doing everything we had to supervised learning but adding to it um the exciting tool of genus of AI so many of you maybe all of you will play their chai GPT and Bob and so on but just you know given a piece of text which you call a prompt like I love eating if you run this multiple times maybe you get bagels cream cheese or my Mother's Meatloaf or um Ultra friends and the AI system can generate output like that um given the amounts of Buzz and excitement about genes of AI I thought I'd take just half a slide to you know say a little bit about how this works so it turns out that germs of AI at least this type of text generation the core of it is using supervised learning that inputs output mappings to repeatedly predict the next word and so if\"\n",
