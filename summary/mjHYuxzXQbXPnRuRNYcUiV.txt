 A group of people flew to Munich to write comedy sketches for Germany. Upon their arrival, they were greeted with large steins of beer and taken straight from the airport. They were then taken to DACA and attempted to find the Dachau concentration camp, but were denied entry. When they mentioned they were Jewish, they were still not allowed to enter. Eventually, they were given a blessing and allowed access.
