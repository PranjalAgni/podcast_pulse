 A group of people flew to Munich to write comedy sketches for Germany. Upon their arrival, they were greeted with large steins of beer and taken straight from the airport to DACA. They then attempted to find the Dachau concentration camp, but were denied entry until they mentioned they were Jewish. They were then allowed to enter and given a blessing.
